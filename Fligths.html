        <p class="project-overview">
            <b>Project Overview: </b>Ever wondered why flights get delayed or cancelled?
            In this project, I set out to answer exactly that question by diving deep into one of the largest flight datasets available.
            Using data from 5.8 million flights across the U.S. in 2015; a year that captured the majority of scheduled flights. I conducted a comprehensive analysis to uncover:
        </p>

        <ul class="project-overview-list">
            <li>Key causes of delays and cancellations</li>
            <li>Patterns across airlines, airports, and time periods</li>
            <li>Seasonal and operational trends that affect flight performance</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-overview">
            The goal of this analysis is not only to understand when and where disruptions happen,
            but also to identify why they occur and what factors play the biggest role.
            By transforming raw flight data into meaningful insights, this project sheds light on air travel reliability
            and helps build a foundation for smarter scheduling, airline performance benchmarking, and potential
            predictive modeling for future disruptions.

            <h2>Cancellation Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                The first part of our analysis, it aims to find the key reasons for cancellations, which airlines have the highest delay rate and more!
                <br>here are the key insights uncovered:
            </p>
            <ul class="project-overview-list">
                <li>
                    90K flights in the U.S have been cancelled, that is 1.54% of the flights
                </li>
                <li>
                    American Eagle Airline had a very high cancellation rate of 5%, that is the double of the second highest cancellation rate!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cancellation rate increases in winter
                </li>
                <li>
                    North Eastern states had a high cancellation rate
                </li>
                <li>
                    About 54% of flights have been cancelled due to weather

                Aims to find out Departure delay rate overall and by other metrics<br>

                <li>
                    9.37 minutes is the average departure delay

                <li>
                    82.41% of flights have been delayed, where a delayed flight is a flight that departed 10+ minutes late
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hawaiian Airlines & Alaska Airlines had the highest delay late, because they're is the farthest states
                </li>
                <li>
                    Departure delay rate is unstable through the year, but it is at is lowest in fall
                </li>
                <li>
                    Departure delay is high for flights that starts between 10PM ~ 4AM

            <h2>Arrival Delays Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                3rd part of our project, aims to find key insights for arrival delays, which are:
            </p>
            <ul class="project-overview-list">
                <li>
                    Average arrival delay is 4.3 minutes

                <li>
                    27.38% of flights have arrival delay, a flight is considered with arrival delay if arrival delay is 5+ minutes

            <h2>Delays by Other Metrics</h2>
            <p>
                This is the final stage of the analysis, we explore delays by other metrics such as overall delay rate (departure, arrival and other types) by time, distance, taxi out time:
            </p>
            <ul class="project-overview-list">
                <li>
                    Texas, california & Florida had the highest overall delay rate, possibly because they are the most populated states
                </li>
                <li>
                    Flight distance & Delay rate have a weak positive correlation, meaning that short flights are most likely to have arrival delays
                </li>
                <li>
                    Taxi out time & Delay rate have a weak negative correlation, meaning that flights with longer taxi out time are least likely to have arrival delays
                </li>
                <li>
                    Overall delay rate is at its lowest between 1AM~4AM, and at its highest between 5AM~8AM

            <h2>What should we do?</h2>
            <p>
                For passengers, it is important to know when and where delays are most likely to happen, so they can plan their trips accordingly.
                so the next time you book a flight, consider the following:
                <ul class="project-overview-list">
                    <li>Choose an appropriate airline: some airlines have high cancellation rates and some other have high delay rates, 
                        by now you should know them.
                        If your travel is urgent and no delays should occur then consider avoiding these airlines</li>
                    <li>Track weather: check for the weather state during ur flight before the flight starts, specially in winter</li>
                    <li>Travel late: delay rates are low between 10PM ~ 4AM, consider traveling by that time</li>
                    <li>Get ready for delays: If you will travel from a highly populated state, put in considerations that your flight might be delayed a little</li>
