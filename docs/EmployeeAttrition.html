        <p class="project-overview">
            <b>Overview: </b>This project focuses on understanding employee attrition, why do employees leave their companies? is it because of the work environment,
            salary, or other factors? The goal is to analyze the data and provide insights that can help organizations improve retention strategies. <br><br>
            In this project, I have used a dataset of employees from a company with over 1400 employees, analyzing various factors such as job satisfaction, 
            salary, and work-life balance to answer:
        </p>
        <ul class="project-overview-list">
            <li>What is the attrition rate for the company?</li>
            <li>What are the main factors contributing to attrition?</li>
            <li>Do employees that leave have any common factors between them?</li>
            <li>Do demographics of employees impact the attrition rate?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="project-overview">
            And more questions that can be answered by analyzing the data. The analysis includes visualizations and statistical methods to draw conclusions
            and provide actionable insights for the company to improve employee retention.<br><br>
            <b>Tools used:</b> PowerBI only have been used, as the dataset was clean and prepared for analysis
